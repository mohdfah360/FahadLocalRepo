	 * Any single feature file can contain more than one scenario. But A feature file
can't have more than one feature if we are trying to create more than one feature then we will get
gherkin parser exception. Some time we may have to execute few scenarios out of all written scenarios 
then we can use this cucumber tags concept- Here we will create different tags with each scenario in the
feature file. Any single scenario can have more than one tags. we can also use tags with our feature as well.
